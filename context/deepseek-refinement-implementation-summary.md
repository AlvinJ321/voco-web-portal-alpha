# Summary: Integrating Deepseek for Text Refinement

This document summarizes the requirement and final implementation for integrating Aliyun Bailian's Deepseek model to refine transcribed text.

## Requirement

The goal was to enhance the `/api/speech` endpoint. After receiving a transcription from the Aliyun ASR service, the text needed to be passed to the Deepseek model via Aliyun Bailian for polishing and refinement before being returned to the user. The solution needed to be cost-effective by managing conversation sessions correctly.

## Solution and Implementation Path

The implementation process involved a key pivot from an initial assumption to a solution based on official documentation.

1.  **Initial Plan:** The first approach was based on the assumption that a dedicated Node.js SDK, tentatively named `@alicloud/bailian`, existed. The initial code included this dependency and a `refiner.js` service built to use it.

2.  **Problem & Discovery:** During dependency installation, it was discovered that the assumed npm package does not exist. Subsequent research and, crucially, a link to the official Aliyun documentation provided by the user, revealed the correct integration method for a Node.js environment.

3.  **Final Solution (HTTP API):** The correct and final implementation uses a direct HTTP POST request to the DashScope API endpoint. This approach is simpler, more robust, and aligns with Aliyun's official guidelines.

### Key Components

*   **API Endpoint (`server/server.js`):** The `/api/speech` endpoint was modified. After a successful transcription, it now calls the `refineText` function, passing the `userId` and the transcribed text.

*   **Refiner Service (`server/utils/refiner.js`):** A new service was created to handle all interactions with the Aliyun Bailian service.
    *   It uses `axios` to send a `POST` request to `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/api/v1/apps/{appId}/completion`.
    *   It includes an in-memory `Map` to manage user sessions. It stores the `session_id` returned by the API and reuses it for subsequent requests from the same user to maintain context and save costs. Sessions expire after 60 minutes of inactivity.

*   **Configuration (`server/.env`):** The service is configured via environment variables:
    *   `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`: The API key obtained from the Bailian console.
    *   `BAILIAN_APP_ID`: The unique ID of the application created in the Bailian console.

*   **System Prompt:** The detailed system prompt, which instructs the model on how to refine the text, is configured directly within the application's settings in the Aliyun Bailian web console, rather than being hardcoded in the application. This separates concerns and allows for easier updates to the prompt.

## Production Considerations: Public vs. Private Endpoint

For production deployment, it is highly recommended to use a private network connection (VPC via PrivateLink) to access the Bailian service for enhanced security, performance, and stability.

*   **Security:** Private endpoints ensure that all API traffic remains within the Alibaba Cloud internal network, preventing exposure to the public internet.
*   **Performance & Stability:** Internal network access typically offers lower latency and higher reliability compared to public internet connections.

The code was updated to support this by introducing an optional environment variable:
*   `DASHSCOPE_API_BASE_URL`: If this variable is set (e.g., to a private endpoint URL like `https://ep-xxx.dashscope.cn-region.privatelink.aliyuncs.com/api/v1`), the application will use this URL. If it's not set, the application defaults to the public endpoint.

This allows for easy switching between development (public) and production (private) environments without code changes.
